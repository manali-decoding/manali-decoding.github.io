                    arrives – is a time of tremendous change, responsibility, and
                    healing. The care new moms receive after giving birth is just as important as their prenatal care.
                    It is surprising that
                    new moms get a wealth of information about pregnancy, labor, and birth from their family,
                    practitioners, and even
                    strangers, but they hear very little about postpartum issues, let alone how to cope with it. There
                    is a deep void about
                    postpartum awareness and there are very few resources that provide information about postpartum
                    care. While new parents
                    spend hours browsing through a ton of blogs, forums, Facebook groups, the information they receive
                    is all scattered.
                    Often times parents are confused because all the information they find on the internet because it is
                    often not accurate,
                    organized and evidence-based.</div>
