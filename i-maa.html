                    period – that is, the months after baby arrives – is a time of tremendous change, responsibility,
                    and
                    healing. The care new moms receive after giving birth is just as important as their prenatal care.
                    It is
                    surprising that new moms get a wealth of information about pregnancy, labor, and birth from their
                    family, practitioners, and even strangers, but they hear very little about postpartum issues, let
                    alone
                    how to cope with it. There is a deep void about postpartum awareness and there are very few
                    resources
                    that provide information about postpartum care. While new parents spend hours browsing through a ton
                    of
                    blogs, forums, Facebook groups, the information they receive is all scattered. Often times parents
                    are
                    confused because all the information they find on the internet because it is often not accurate,
                    organized and evidence-based.</div>
